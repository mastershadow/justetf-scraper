# ⚡ justetf-scraper

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the `justetf-scraper` up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
-   **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mastershadow/justetf-scraper.git
    cd justetf-scraper
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

To run the scraper, execute the `main.py` script. The script's internal logic will determine the target URLs and data extraction rules.

```bash
python main.py
```

After execution, scraped data will typically be saved in the `out/` directory. You might need to inspect `main.py` to understand specific command-line arguments if supported, or to modify target URLs and extraction logic directly.

### Configuration Files
-   `requirements.txt`: Manages Python package dependencies.
